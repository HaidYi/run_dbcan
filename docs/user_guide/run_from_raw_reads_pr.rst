Example 3: Priest2023 Dataset :cite:`2023:Priest`
-------------------------------------------------

The Wastyk2021 dataset :cite:`2023:Priest` was published in 2021 from a human dietary intervention study. In the published paper, researchers studied how high-fermented and high-fiber diets influence the human microbiome metabolism and modulate the human immune status. 
Among various data analyses conducted in the paper, 
CAZymes were mined from shotgun metagenomic reads of 18 healthy human participants, and each participant had four time points of stool samples for metagenome sequencing. 
CAZyme abundance profiles were compared before and after the high-fiber intervention (baseline vs high-fiber). One of the main findings from their CAZyme analysis was that high-fiber consumption increased the CAZyme abundance. 
For this protocol, we will select two samples (paired-end 2x146bp reads) of two time points (day 2 before high-fiber diet as baseline, and 10 weeks after high-fiber diet as intervention) from one participant
The protocol is for the individual sample route.

The Priest2023 dataset :cite:`2021:Wastyk` was published in 20211 from a human dietary intervention study. In the published paper, researchers studied how high-fermented and high-fiber diets influence the human microbiome metabolism and modulate the human immune status. Among various data analyses conducted in the paper1, CAZymes were mined from shotgun metagenomic reads of 18 healthy human participants, and each participant had four time points of stool samples for metagenome sequencing. CAZyme abundance profiles were compared before and after the high-fiber intervention (baseline vs high-fiber). One of the main findings from their CAZyme analysis was that high-fiber consumption increased the CAZyme abundance. For this protocol, we will select two samples (paired-end 2x146bp reads) of two time points (day 2 before high-fiber diet as baseline, and 10 weeks after high-fiber diet as intervention) from one participant (Table S2). The protocol is for the individual sample route (Fig. 3).
